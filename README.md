When doing an analysis on any systems, it's important to ensure that actions do not negatively affect the system in review.  While this is a noble goal, it's not always a realistic goal.  To deconflict who/how in the aftermath, we recommend using the `script` command.

## System Check

To check for unix system vulnerabilities, we recommend using the tools listed below:

* [lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis)
* [unix-privesc-check](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check)
* [Using SysInternals Tools Like a Pro](https://www.howtogeek.com/school/sysinternals-pro/)

Both of these are formidable tool sets and both of are freely available.

## Jurassic Tools

* Netcat: [netcat](netcat/)
* Memory dumps: [memory](memory/)
